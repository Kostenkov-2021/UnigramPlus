* Added keyboard shortcuts for navigating to the next and previous search results in chat. By default, these functions are assigned to the ALT+K and ALT+J key combinations.
* Added a keyboard shortcut for opening a list with all the search results in chat. By default, this function is assigned to the ALT+I key combination.
* Now, double-pressing the left arrow on a message will shift focus to the message that the current message is replying to.
* Fixed an issue where descriptions of links embedded in messages were not being read.
* UnigramPlus will no longer suggest updates on protected screens. However, users will need to open NVDA settings one more time and click the "Use the last saved settings during login and reading of protected screens (administrator rights required)" button.
* Removed the feature for rewinding voice messages and the feature for setting reactions to messages, as these features were not working reliably.
* Removed the message copying feature, as Unigram now has this function. Be aware that sometimes copying messages may cause a slight freezing of the program, but this is not related to UnigramPlus.
* Fixed some other minor bugs.
