* Added the ability to select files attached to messages with horizontal arrows and open the selected file with the space bar.
* Now links in messages will not be read in full, but only up to the question mark.
* Now, when you close the photo or video viewer, UnigramPlus will try to set the focus on the message you were viewing.
* The keyboard shortcut to open UnigramPlus settings has been changed. Now this function is assigned to the combination NVDA+ALT+U.
* Code optimisation has been done, resulting in significantly improved response time when navigating the chat list and message list. This is especially noticeable on messages that contain many nested elements.
* Many minor issues have been fixed.
* A lot of outdated code has been removed.
